    "This book sprint was held December 6-9, 2019 at Engineers House in Bristol, United Kingdom (https://www.makeuk.org/venues/engineers-house-bristol). We are grateful to Martyn Bowen and  the staff at Engineers House for providing a comfortable, stimulating, and inspiring environment which facilitated the intensive work  and collaboration  that was required to make this book sprint successful. \n",

    "Funding for the book sprint was provided by the Chemistry and Mathematics in Phase Space (CHAMPS)  project (https://champsproject.com/). This is a six year  Programme Grant funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) led by the School of Mathematics at the University of Bristol, and in collaboration  with the School of Chemistry at the University of Bristol, the School of Chemistry at Cardiff University, the School of Chemistry at Leeds University, and the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College.\n",
