It is straightforward to show that they are invariant and that any phase space point starting on the unstable (stable) manifold will approach the NHIM as $t \\to -\\infty$ ($t \\to +\\infty$). Moreover, if an initial condition is inside the spherical cylinder correspinitialonding to the stable (unstable) manifold, then it will cross the phase space bottleneck that opens in the neighborhood of the index-1 saddle at the origin in forward (backward) time. Consequently, the trajectories of these initial conditions can be classified as reactive trajectories that go from the reactants to the products region. For this reason, the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM are known in the Chemistry literature as reactive cylinders, giving rise to reactive islands when they intersect a Poincare section of the phase space. On the other hand, if an initial condition is outside the spherical cylinders, the trajectory will not cross from reactants to products, and that trajectory would be classified as non-reactive.

The construction of a dividing surface for general index *k* saddles was given in \\{% collins:244105 %}.  However, in this section we describe a ''global dividing surface'' that is associated with an index two saddle point and two index one saddle points. Such a structure was constructed in analyzing the isomerization dynamics of a buckled nanobeam in {% collins2012isomerization %}. Intriguingly, a similar geometrical structure arises in the study of the ''roaming'' phenomenon in {% Harding_et_al_2012; suits14 %}. Consequently, this type of geometrical structure could be more widespread in reaction dynamics so we believe it may be useful to give an analytically tractable example of such a situation.\n",
