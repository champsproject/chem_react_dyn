It is straightforward to show that they are invariant and that any phase space point starting on the unstable (stable) manifold will approach the NHIM as $t \\to -\\infty$ ($t \\to +\\infty$). Moreover, if an initial condition is inside the spherical cylinder correspinitialonding to the stable (unstable) manifold, then it will cross the phase space bottleneck that opens in the neighborhood of the index-1 saddle at the origin in forward (backward) time. Consequently, the trajectories of these initial conditions can be classified as reactive trajectories that go from the reactants to the products region. For this reason, the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM are known in the Chemistry literature as reactive cylinders, giving rise to reactive islands when they intersect a Poincare section of the phase space. On the other hand, if an initial condition is outside the spherical cylinders, the trajectory will not cross from reactants to products, and that trajectory would be classified as non-reactive.

However, in this section we describe a ''global dividing surface'' that is associated with an index two saddle point and two index one saddle points. Such a structure was constructed in analyzing the isomerization dynamics of a buckled nanobeam in \\cite{collins2012isomerization}. Intriguingly, a similar geometrical structure arises in the study of the ''roaming'' phenomenon in \\cite{Harding_et_al_2012, suits14}.

    "In order to consider a surface to be a dividing surface  we need to understand what the surface is dividing. In the language of chemical reactions,  index one saddles give rise to dividing surfaces that  divide reactants and products.  The examples above were designed  only to illustrate the geometry associated with the passage of trajectories through a dividing surface. In particular,  in the examples ''reactants'' corresponded to a region have a particular sign of the $q_1$  coordinate and ''products'' corresponded to a region corresponding to the opposite sign of the $q_1$ coordinate. and it was arbitrary which region was considered reactants and which products.
