Using a widely-studied model of chaotic advection as a test case we give a method for quantifying the quality of interpolation methods and apply this to a variety of interpolation schemes in space only and in both space and time. It is shown that the performance of a method when interpolating in space is not a reliable predictor of its performance when interpolation in time is added. It is demonstrated that a method using bicubic spatial interpolation together with third-order Lagrange polynomials in time gives excellent accuracy at very modest computational expense compared to other methods.},

	of Poincar´e ideas of seeking structures that divide it into regions

	have been a very useful approach for studying dynamical systems. However 
	while these representations are well achieved for autonomous and time

The ﬁrst challenge for describing transport in aperiodical time dependent ﬂows is obtaining a representation of the phase portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identiﬁed. This representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which transport routes are acting on the whole ﬂow. Once these routes are roughly recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct computation of the ﬁnite time stable and unstable manifolds of special hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the ﬂow.},

First we develop a benchmark method in which all the trajectories composing the manifold are integrated from the neighborhood of the hyperbolic trajectory. This choice, although very accurate, is not fast and has limited usage. A faster and more powerful algorithm requires the insertion of new points in the manifold as it evolves in time. Its numerical implementation requires a criterion for determining when to insert those points in the manifold, and an interpolation method for determining where to insert them. We compare four different point insertion criteria and four different interpolation methods. We discuss the computational requirements of all of these methods. We ﬁnd two of the four point insertion criteria to be accurate and robust. One is a variant of a criterion originally proposed by Hobson. The other is a slight variant of a method due to Dritschel and Ambaum arising from their studies of contour dynamics. The preferred interpolation method is also due to Dritschel.

	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical background for Lagrangian Descriptors (LDs). The goal of achieving rigourous proofs that justify the ability of LDs to detect invariant manifolds is simpliﬁed by introducing an alternative deﬁnition for LDs. The deﬁnition is stated for n-dimensional systems with general time dependence, however we rigorously prove that this method reveals the stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points in four particular 2D cases: a hyperbolic saddle point for linear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for linear nonautonomous systems and a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear nonautonomous systems. We also discuss further rigorous results which show the ability of LDs to highlight additional invariants sets, such as n-tori. These results are just a simple extension of the ergodic partition theory which we illustrate by applying this methodology to well-known examples, such as the planar ﬁeld of the harmonic oscillator and the 3D ABC ﬂow. Finally, we provide a thorough discussion on the requirement of the objectivity (frameinvariance) property for tools designed to reveal phase space structures and their implications for Lagrangian descriptors.},

	abstract = {Transition-state theories describing barrierless chemical reactions, or more general activated problems, are often hampered by the lack of a saddle around which the dividing surface can be constructed. For example, the timedependent transition-state trajectory uncovering the nonrecrossing dividing surface in thermal reactions in the framework of the Langevin equation has relied on perturbative approaches in the vicinity of the saddle. We recently obtained an alternative approach using Lagrangian descriptors to construct time-dependent and recrossing-free dividing surfaces. This is a nonperturbative approach making no reference to a putative saddle. Here we show how the Lagrangian descriptor can be used to obtain the transition-state geometry of a dissipated and thermalized reaction across barrierless potentials. We illustrate the method in the case of a 1D Brownian motion for both barrierless and step potentials; however, the method is not restricted and can be directly applied to diﬀerent kinds of potentials and higher dimensional systems.},

Recent advances in dynamical systems theory have helped to identify the interconnected manifolds—‘‘superhighways”—leading from reactants to products. The existence of these manifolds has been proven rigorously, and explicit algorithms are available for their calculation. We now show that these extended structures can be used to obtain reaction rates directly in dissipative systems. We also suggest a treatment for the substantially more general case in which the molecular solvent is fully speciﬁed by the positions of all its atoms. Speciﬁcally, we can construct effective solvent conﬁgurations for which the exact TST manifolds can be constructed and used to sample the rates of an open system.},

The ﬁrst challenge for describing transport in aperiodical time dependent ﬂows is obtaining a representation of the phase portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identiﬁed. This representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which transport routes are acting on the whole ﬂow. Once these routes are roughly recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct computation of the ﬁnite time stable and unstable manifolds of special hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the ﬂow.},

This choice, although very accurate, is not fast and has limited usage. A faster and more powerful algorithm requires the insertion of new points in the manifold as it evolves in time. Its numerical implementation requires a criterion for determining when to insert those points in the manifold, and an interpolation method for determining where to insert them. We compare four different point insertion criteria and four different interpolation methods. We discuss the computational requirements of all of these methods. We ﬁnd two of the four point insertion criteria to be accurate and robust. One is a variant of a criterion originally proposed by Hobson. The other is a slight variant of a method due to Dritschel and Ambaum arising from their studies of contour dynamics. The preferred interpolation method is also due to Dritschel. These methods are then applied to the computation of the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic trajectories of several aperiodically time-dependent variants of the Dufﬁng equation.},

	certain regions of the phase space is only possible via narrow bottlenecks 
	created by the inﬂuence of the equilibrium points. In this paper we provide 
	a thorough pedagogical description of the phase space structures that are 
	responsible for controlling transport in these problems. Of central 
	importance is the existence of a Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold 
	(NHIM), whose stable and unstable manifolds have suﬃcient dimensionality to 
	act as separatrices, partitioning energy surfaces into regions of 
	qualitatively distinct behavior. This NHIM forms the natural (dynamical) 
	equator of a (spherical) dividing surface which locally divides an energy 
	surface into two components (“reactants” and “products”), one on either 
	side of the bottleneck. This dividing surface has all the desired 
	properties sought for in transition state theory where reaction rates are 
	computed from the ﬂux through a dividing surface. In fact, the dividing 
	surface that we construct is crossed exactly once by reactive trajectories, 
	and not crossed by nonreactive trajectories, and related to these 
	properties, minimizes the ﬂux upon variation of the dividing surface.},

	lack of a saddle around which the dividing surface can be constructed. For 
	example, the timedependent transition-state trajectory uncovering the 
	nonrecrossing dividing surface in thermal reactions in the framework of the 
	Langevin equation has relied on perturbative approaches in the vicinity of 
	the saddle. We recently obtained an alternative approach using Lagrangian 
	descriptors to construct time-dependent and recrossing-free dividing 
	surfaces. This is a nonperturbative approach making no reference to a 
	putative saddle. Here we show how the Lagrangian descriptor can be used to 
	obtain the transition-state geometry of a dissipated and thermalized 
	reaction across barrierless potentials. We illustrate the method in the 
	case of a 1D Brownian motion for both barrierless and step potentials; 
	however, the method is not restricted and can be directly applied to 
	diﬀerent kinds of potentials and higher dimensional systems.},
