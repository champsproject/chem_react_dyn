The Hamiltonian has the form of the sum of the  kinetic energy and the potential energy (the Morse potential).  The Hamiltonian system is integrable, and all trajectories lie on the level sets of the Hamiltonian function.  The level sets can be used to derive integrals that give (time) parametrizations of trajectories. Regions of closed (bounded) trajectories can be used to construct special coordinates--*action-angle coordinates*, where the angle denotes a particular location on the closed level set and the action is the area enclosed by a closed level set (divided by $2 \\pi$). The transformation to action-angle coordinates for integrable Hamiltonan systems is a standard topic in good classical mechanics textbooks, see, e.g. {% cite landau1960mechanics arnold2013mathematical --file action_angle.bib %}. The transformation preserves the Hamiltonian nature of the system, i.e. it is a canonical transformation, and therefore the standard approach to constructing such transformations is through the use of generating functions. However, for one degree-of-freedom time-independent Hamiltonian systems (such as the one described by the Morse potential)  there is a simpler approach to generating the action-angle transformation that uses the geometry of the closed level set of the Hamiltonian function and the explicit (time) parametrization of the trajectories that can  be obtained (in principle, if the necessary integrals can be explicitly computed)  for one degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems. The approach is inspired by the seminal paper of Melnikov {% cite melnikov1963vk --file action_angle.bib %}.
