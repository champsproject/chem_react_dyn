    "The potential energy function derived by P. M. Morse is truly a ''workhorse''  potential energy function in theoretical chemistry \\cite{morse1929diatomic}.  Originally it was devised to describe the intermolecular force between the two atoms in a diatomic molecule. It has the functional form:\n",

    "where $q$ represents the distance between the two atoms, $D >0$ represents the depth of the potential well (defined relative to the dissociated atoms), and $\\alpha >0$ controls the width of the potential well ($\\alpha$ small corresponds to a ''wide'' well, $\\alpha$ large corresponds to a narrow well). \n",

    "The Morse potential defines a one degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system, i.e. the phase space is two dimensional described by coordinates $(q, p)$, where $p$ is the momentum conjugate to the position variable $q$.  The Hamiltonian has the form of the sum of the  kinetic energy and the potential energy (the Morse potential).  The Hamiltonian system is integrable, and all trajectories lie on the level sets of the Hamiltonian function.  The level sets can be used to derive integrals that give (time) parametrizations of trajectories. Regions of closed (bounded) trajectories can be used to construct special coordinates--*action-angle coordinates*, where the angle denotes a particular location on the closed level set and the action is the area enclosed by a closed level set (divided by $2 \\pi$). The transformation to action-angle coordinates for integrable Hamiltonan systems is a standard topic in good classical mechanics textbooks, see, e.g. \\cite{landau1960mechanics, arnold2013mathematical}. The transformation preserves the Hamiltonian nature of the system, i.e. it is a canonical transformation, and therefore the standard approach to constructing such transformations is through the use of generating functions. However, for one degree-of-freedom time-independent Hamiltonian systems (such as the one described by the Morse potential)  there is a simpler approach to generating the action-angle transformation that uses the geometry of the closed level set of the Hamiltonian function and the explicit (time) parametrization of the trajectories that can  be obtained (in principle, if the necessary integrals can be explicitly computed)  for one degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems. The approach is inspired by the seminal paper of Melnikov \\cite{melnikov1963vk}. This approach was developed in detail in \\cite{wiggins1990introduction} (the 1990 edition, *not* the 2003 edition) and is also described in \\cite{mezic1994integrability}. This is the approach that we will follow here.\n",

    "Action-angle variables are important in Hamiltonian mechanics for a number of reasons. From the point of view of classical mechanics they are the coordinate system used for the development of the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser and Nekhoroshev theorems \\cite{dumas2014kam}. They also play a central role in the quantization of classical Hamiltonian systems (in fact, the action and the constant $\\hbar$ have the same units) \\cite{stone2005einstein, keller1958corrected, keller1960asymptotic, keller1985semiclassical}. \n"

    "\\cite{wiggins1990introduction} are examples of global perturbation methods that consider the effect of perturbations on the entire unperturbed integrable system, such as the Morse oscillator that we have considered. The type of perturbation that we will consider is a time periodic excitation of the Morse oscillator. The subharmonic and homoclinic Melnikov methods for this system have been previously considered in \\cite{guo2003dynamical}, however, with respect to chaotic dynamics, important technical details for this periodically perturbed Morse oscillator were not considered. We will describe these in detail here, as well as consider the nature of the effect of the parameters of the Morse potential, and the periodic excitation, on chaotic dynamics.\n",

    "The homoclinic Melnikov function is a well-known and popular method for proving the existence of chaos, in the sense of Smale horseshoes, in time periodically perturbed one degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems. The method allows one to prove the existence of transverse homoclinic periodic orbits to a hyperbolic periodic orbit. Such orbits admit a Smale horseshoe construction. There are two issues with the application of the standard homoclinic Melnikov function to the time periodically perturbed Morse oscillator, and  both issues arise from the fact that the saddle point at infinity is parabolic, not hyperbolic. One issue is the fact that the standard derivation of the homoclinic Melnikov function uses hyperbolicity of the fixed point to show that certain terms in the Melnikov function vanish. The other issue involves the construction of the Smale horseshoe map for orbits homoclinic to a parabolic point. Both issue are considered for the perturbed Morse oscillator in \\cite{beigie1992dynamics} where it is shown that the growth and decay properties for the parabolic point in the Morse oscillator are sufficient for the standard Melnikov function to be valid as well as the Smale horseshoe map construction to be valid. Hence, the ''Melnikov approach'' is sufficient for determining the existence of chaos for the time-periodically perturbed Morse oscillator. \n",
