A caldera PES  arises  in many organic chemical reactions, such as the  vinylcyclopropane-cyclopentene rearrangement {% cite baldwin2003 gold1988 --file caldera2c.bib %}, the stereomutation of cyclopropane {% cite doubleday1997 --file caldera2c.bib %}, the degenerate rearrangement of bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene {% cite doubleday1999 doubleday2006 --file caldera2c.bib %} or that of 5-methylenebicyclo[2.1.0]pentane {% cite reyes2002 --file caldera2c.bib %}. It is characterized by a flat region or shallow minimum at its center  surrounded by potential walls and multiple symmetry related index one saddle points that allow entrance and exit from this intermediate region. This shape of the potential resembles  the collapsed  region within an errupted volcano (caldera), and this is the reason that Doering {% cite doering2002 --file caldera2c.bib %} and co-workers  refer to this type of  potential  as a caldera.\n", "\n", "The manifestation of the dynamical matching phenomenon is essentially a statement of  momentum conservation and Newton's first law of motion. It is observed that a trajectory entering the Caldera from a channel corresponding to a high energy index-1 saddle (reactant) experiences little force in the caldera due to the ''flatness'' of the PES, and it exits through the diametrically opposing low energy index-1 saddle (product). Consequently, this mechanism determines to a considerable extent the outcome of the chemical reaction. However, not all trajectories entering the caldera experience dynamical matching. It is observed that some trajectories may interact with the shallow potential well and become temporarily trapped in the region. This can dramatically influence the manner in which they exit from the well. \n", "\n", "A detailed study of the trajectory behavior in a two DoF caldera PES was given in {% cite collins2014 --file caldera2c.bib %}, where a more general discussion of caldera-like PESs in organic reactions is also presented.

We will describe the results in these papers in more detail when we describe the Hamiltonian model in the next section.\n", "\n", "In this chapter we describe the phase space mechanism that controls dynamical matching. We show that  dynamical matching is controlled by a heteroclinic intersection between the unstable manifold of a periodic orbit controlling entrance to the caldera and the stable manifold of a periodic orbit  in the region of the shallow minimum.  When a heteroclinic connection exists, trajectories that enter the caldera are transported to the shallow minimum, and they experience temporary trapping in this region. When there is no heteroclinic connection, trajectories enter and exit the caldera without interacting with the  region of the central minimum.  Knowledge of this phase space mechanism is significant because it allows us to predict existence, and non-existence, of dynamical matching.\n", "\n", "This chapter is outlined as follows.

If the heteroclinic connection breaks, as might occur if a parameter is varied, the mechanism for directing trajectories towards the regions of the central minimum no longer exists, and dynamical matching is possible.
