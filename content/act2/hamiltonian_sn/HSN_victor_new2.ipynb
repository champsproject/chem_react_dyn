The description of such mechanisms requires analyzing how the bonds change in time, that is, it is a *dynamical* mechanism requiring a phase space description. The phase space will have coordinates that correspond to the bond configurations with a corresponding canonical momentum for each bond configuration coordinate. Thus, the dynamics of chemical bonds can be formulated in the language of Hamiltonian dynamics and its resulting phase space geometry. In recent years there has been significant developments in the mathematical description and analysis of chemical reaction dynamics in phase space.{% cite Komatsuzaki00 uzer2002geometry Komatsuzaki02a --file HamSN.bib %}\n", "\n", "Our objective is to describe the change in a bond that signals the occurrence of a chemical reaction in terms of a unique characteristic of a trajectory of Hamilton's equations. This characteristic requires an understanding of the geometry of the phase space of the molecule in a way that enables us to divide an appropriate volume of phase space into a region corresponding to ''reactants'' and a region corresponding to ''products''. The passage from reactants to products, that is ''reaction'', occurs when a trajectory crosses the ''dividing surface'' (DS) between the reactants and products. In this framework for understanding chemical reactions, the flux through such a dividing surface would be related to the reaction rate, and therefore the construction of a DS between such regions is of interest in reaction dynamics. The description of the regions of reactants and products can often be inferred from the nature of the development of the coordinates used in the mathematical model of the chemical reaction. Once the model is developed, the DS must be constructed in the context of this model. In relating the flux through the DS to a reaction rate it is desirable that trajectories crossing the DS from the reactant side proceed to the product side before possibly recrossing the DS back to the reactant region. Thus, we require the DS to have the ''no-recrossing'' property {% cite MacKay90 waalkens2004direct --file HamSN.bib %}. Since Hamiltonian dynamics conserves energy, the trajectories evolve on the energy surface, which is of codimension one in phase space. The DS is required to be codimension one in the energy surface. Hence, we require a DS between reactants and products to be codimension one in the energy surface and to have the no-recrossing property. We note that Wigner had already described these properties for a DS in phase space much earlier {% cite Wigner38 Wigner39 --file HamSN.bib %}, and a review of classical and quantum versions of DS constructed in phase space can be found in {% cite WaalkensSchubertWiggins08 --file HamSN.bib %}. \n", "\n", "The construction of a DS separating the phase space into two parts, reactants and products, has been a focus from the dynamical systems point of view in recent years. However, the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the construction of such surfaces for molecular systems with three and more degree-of-freedom (DoF) has until recently been a major obstacle in the development of the theory. In phase space, that is for nonzero momentum, the role of the *saddle point* is played by an *invariant manifold* of saddle stability type, the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) (see \\ref{sec:HSN_2DOF}) {% cite Wiggins88 wiggins90 wiggins2013normally --file HamSN.bib %}. In order to fully appreciate the NHIM and its role in reaction rate theory, it is useful to begin with a precursor concept -- the *periodic orbit dividing surface* or PODS. For systems with two DoF described by a natural Hamiltonian, kinetic plus potential energy, the problem of constructing the DS in phase space was solved during the 1970s by McLafferty, Pechukas and Pollak {% cite Pechukas73 Pechukas77 Pollak78 Pechukas79 --file HamSN.bib %}. They demonstrated that the DS at a specific energy is related to an invariant phase space structure, an unstable periodic orbit (UPO). The UPO defines (it is the boundary of) the bottleneck in phase space through which the reaction occurs and the DS which intersects trajectories evolving from reactants to products can be shown to have the geometry of a hemisphere in phase space whose boundary is the unstable PO {% cite wiggins2001impenetrable waalkens2004direct --file HamSN.bib %}. The same construction can be carried out for a DS intersecting trajectories crossing from products to reactants and these two hemispheres form a sphere for which the UPO is the equator. Generalisation of this construction of DS to high dimensional systems has been a central question in reaction dynamics and has only received a satisfactory answer in recent years {% cite wiggins2001impenetrable uzer2002geometry --file HamSN.bib %}.

In a general context, a saddle-node bifurcation takes place when a saddle and an elliptic equilibrium point of a dynamical system 'collide' as the value of a physical parameter is varied. This phenomenon occurs naturally in a Chemistry setup as a consequence of lowering the energy barrier height associated to a saddle point of a given potential energy surface (PES), which results in the connection of the potential well region on one side of the saddle to a escape channel. Therefore, this mechanism facilitates that trajectories cross the phase space bottleneck in the neighborhood of the index-1 saddle, and hence has a great influence on reaction dynamics.

In this situation, the equilibrium conformation of the given molecule A is represented by a potential well in a PES, and dissociation into B and C can take place if the system has sufficient energy to cross the potential barrier that separates bounded (vibration) from unbounded (bond breakup) motion.

Since we are using a small integration time of $\\tau = 10$ to compute LDs, the complete geometry of the homoclinic tangle is not fully revealed. Therefore, in order to recover a more complete and intricate dynamical picture of the homoclinic tangle, the integration time to compute LDs has to be increased.

This will result in blank regions in the Poincar\\'e sections as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:ps_vs_ld_2} A) and C). However, we note that trapped trajectories in the potential well corresponding to regular (motion on the tori) and chaotic motion are highlighted as expected in the Poincar\\'e sections.
