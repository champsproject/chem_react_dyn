    "Molecular reaction dynamics is concerned with the breaking and forming of bonds between the atoms that make up a molecule. The description of such mechanisms requires analyzing how the bonds change in time, that is, it is a *dynamical* mechanism requiring a phase space description. The phase space will have coordinates that correspond to the bond configurations with a corresponding canonical momentum for each bond configuration coordinate. Thus, the dynamics of chemical bonds can be formulated in the language of Hamiltonian dynamics and its resulting phase space geometry. In recent years there has been significant developments in the mathematical description and analysis of chemical reaction dynamics in phase space {% cite Komatsuzaki00 uzer2002geometry Komatsuzaki02a --file HamSN %}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to describe the change in a bond that signals the occurrence of a chemical reaction in terms of a unique characteristic of a trajectory of Hamilton's equations. This characteristic requires an understanding of the geometry of the phase space of the molecule in a way that enables us to divide an appropriate volume of phase space into a region corresponding to ''reactants'' and a region corresponding to ''products''. The passage from reactants to products, that is ''reaction'', occurs when a trajectory crosses the ''dividing surface'' (DS) between the reactants and products. In this framework for understanding chemical reactions, the flux through such a dividing surface would be related to the reaction rate, and therefore the construction of a DS between such regions is of interest in reaction dynamics. The description of the regions of reactants and products can often be inferred from the nature of the development of the coordinates used in the mathematical model of the chemical reaction. Once the model is developed, the DS must be constructed in the context of this model. In relating the flux through the DS to a reaction rate it is desirable that trajectories crossing the DS from the reactant side proceed to the product side before possibly recrossing the DS back to the reactant region. Thus, we require the DS to have the ''no-recrossing'' property {% cite MacKay90 waalkens2004direct --file HamSN %}. Since Hamiltonian dynamics conserves energy, the trajectories evolve on the energy surface, which is of codimension one in phase space. The DS is required to be codimension one in the energy surface. Hence, we require a DS between reactants and products to be codimension one in the energy surface and to have the no-recrossing property. We note that Wigner had already described these properties for a DS in phase space much earlier {% cite Wigner38 Wigner39 --file HamSN %}, and a review of classical and quantum versions of DS constructed in phase space can be found in {% cite WaalkensSchubertWiggins08 --file HamSN %}. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of a DS separating the phase space into two parts, reactants and products, has been a focus from the dynamical systems point of view in recent years. However, the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the construction of such surfaces for molecular systems with three and more degree-of-freedom (DoF) has until recently been a major obstacle in the development of the theory. In phase space, that is for nonzero momentum, the role of the *saddle point* is played by an *invariant manifold* of saddle stability type, the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) (see <span style='color:red'>sec:HSN_2DOF</span>) {% cite Wiggins88 wiggins90 wiggins2013normally --file HamSN %}. In order to fully appreciate the NHIM and its role in reaction rate theory, it is useful to begin with a precursor concept -- the *periodic orbit dividing surface* or PODS. For systems with two DoF described by a natural Hamiltonian, kinetic plus potential energy, the problem of constructing the DS in phase space was solved during the 1970s by McLafferty, Pechukas and Pollak {% cite Pechukas73 Pechukas77 Pollak78 Pechukas79 --file HamSN %}. They demonstrated that the DS at a specific energy is related to an invariant phase space structure, an unstable periodic orbit (UPO). The UPO defines (it is the boundary of) the bottleneck in phase space through which the reaction occurs and the DS which intersects trajectories evolving from reactants to products can be shown to have the geometry of a hemisphere in phase space whose boundary is the unstable PO {% cite wiggins2001impenetrable waalkens2004direct --file HamSN %}. The same construction can be carried out for a DS intersecting trajectories crossing from products to reactants and these two hemispheres form a sphere for which the UPO is the equator. Generalisation of this construction of DS to high dimensional systems has been a central question in reaction dynamics and has only received a satisfactory answer in recent years {% cite wiggins2001impenetrable uzer2002geometry --file HamSN %}. The key difficulty concerns the high dimensional analogue of the unstable PO used in the two DoF system for the construction of the DS. This difficulty is resolved by considering the NHIM, which has the appropriate dimensionality for anchoring the dividing surface in phase space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results from dynamical systems theory show that transport in phase space is controlled by high dimensional manifolds, NHIMs, which are the natural generalisation of the UPO of the two DoF case {% cite wiggins90 --file HamSN %}. Normal hyperbolicity of these invariant manifolds means that their stability, in a precise sense, is of saddle type in the transverse direction, which implies that they possess stable and unstable invariant manifolds that are impenetrable barriers and mediate transport in phase space. These invariant manifolds of the NHIM are structurally stable, that is, stable under perturbation {% cite wiggins2013normally --file HamSN %}.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we describe the influence of Hamiltonian saddle-node bifurcations on the high-dimensional phase space structures that mediate transport and characterize reaction dynamics {% cite GG2019 --file HamSN %}. We do so by identifying the relevant invariant manifolds, NHIMs and their stable and unstable manifolds, using the method of Lagrangian descriptors (LDs). In a general context, a saddle-node bifurcation takes place when a saddle and an elliptic equilibrium point of a dynamical system 'collide' as the value of a physical parameter is varied. This phenomenon occurs naturally in a Chemistry setup as a consequence of lowering the energy barrier height associated to a saddle point of a given potential energy surface (PES), which results in the connection of the potential well region on one side of the saddle to a escape channel. Therefore, this mechanism facilitates that trajectories cross the phase space bottleneck in the neighborhood of the index-1 saddle, and hence has a great influence on reaction dynamics. The drastic changes produced in the geometry of the phase space structures can then be used to account for corrections to Kramers' reaction rate as the barrier height decreases {% cite hathcock2019renormalization --file HamSN %}, providing a significant step for the experimental study of single bond dynamics of molecules and the control of micro- and nano-electromechanical devices {% cite hathcock2019renormalization husson2009force miller2012escape herbert2017predictability --file HamSN %}. A nice example regarding the influence of Hamiltonian saddle-node bifurcations on isomerization dynamics can be found in that of the LiCN/LiNC molecule {% cite borondo1995 borondo1996 revuelta2019unveiling --file HamSN %}. Other applications include the study of ionization and dissociation rates in atomic systems {% cite de_leon_intramolecular_1981 mitchell_geometry_2003_I mitchell_geometry_2003_II mitchell_chaos-induced_2004 mitchell_analysis_2004 mitchell_structure_2007 mitchell_nonlinear_2009 wang_photoionization_2010 --file HamSN %}.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the framework of chemical reaction dynamics, saddle-node bifurcations occur in problems that address the escape from a potential well by crossing an energy barrier and the influence that the barrier height has on the reactive flux. These situations can be identified for instance with dissociation or fragmentation reactions, where a chemical transformation takes place if the bond of a molecule A breaks up, giving rise to two products B and C. In this situation, the equilibrium conformation of the given molecule A is represented by a potential well in a PES, and dissociation into B and C can take place if the system has sufficient energy to cross the potential barrier that separates bounded (vibration) from unbounded (bond breakup) motion. This phenomenon can be modeled for instance by means of a cubic potential energy function as illustrated in Fig. [fig:1](#fig:pes_snbif), which will be our building block to construct the normal form Hamiltonian that describes saddle-node bifurcations in phase space. Our goal is to determine the geometrical phase space structures that ''divide'' reactants from products, and identify dynamically distinct phase space regions corresponding to reactive and non-reactive initial conditions for the dynamical system."

The reason for doing so is that they satisfy the condition $\\omega^2 > 2\\sqrt{\\mu}$ and consequently a critical value of the perturbation parameter exists, given by $\\varepsilon_c = 25/9$, at which the two equilibrium points 'collide' at the origin resulting in a *saddle-node bifurcation*. The dynamics after this collision is beyond the scope of this study and therefore we will only focus on the description of the system dynamics for different values of the coupling strength $\\varepsilon < \\varepsilon_c$. Observe in Fig. [fig:2](#fig:figpes_2dof) A) and B) that the location of the well  lies on the $q$-axis when the DoF are uncoupled $(\\varepsilon = 0)$. As $\\varepsilon$ is increased, Fig. [fig:2](#fig:figpes_2dof) C) and D) show that its effect is to *tilt* the PES with respect to the configuration space plane, and the position of the potential well moves off the $q$-axis towards the origin.

We can thus think about the resulting dynamics as a perturbation of the uncoupled case. Given an energy of the system below that of the barrier, that is $H_0 \\leq 0$, the phase space bottleneck is closed and trajectories are trapped in the potential well region. However, due to the perturbation, the regular motion that existed on the tori in the uncoupled system is destroyed as given by the KAM theorem, and  therefore chaotic motion arises in some regions of the phase space.

    "To finish the analysis, we consider the dynamics when the total energy is above that of the index-1 saddle, that is $H_0 > 0$, and in particular we will set $H_0 = 0.05$ in our computations. In this situation, a phase space bottleneck opens up in the barrier region, as shown in Fig. [fig:3](#fig:EnergySurf_Hills). In order to describe the structures that mediate reaction dynamics, that is the NHIM (or unstable periodic orbit) and its stable and unstable manifolds, we use differential correction and continuation along with globalization as described in {% cite Koon2011 naik2017geometry naik2019b GG2019 --file HamSN %}. In Fig. [fig:5](#fig:set2_manifolds_upo_energysurf) panels C) and D), we show the cylindrical manifolds along with the energy surface and the unstable periodic orbit. In order to recover the homoclinic tangle geometry of the invariant manifolds, we calculate LDs on the surfaces of section $\\mathcal{U}^{+}_{qp}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{+}_{xp_x}$, and compare with the direct numerical construction of these invariant manifolds. This LD based diagnostic is similar to performing a ''phase space tomography'' of the high dimensional phase space structures using a low dimensional slice. In Fig. [fig:7](#fig:LD_NHIM_detect) we show the computation of variable time LDs for an integration time $\\tau = 10$ on the slice $\\mathcal{U}^{+}_{qp}$. We observe that Lagrangian descriptors clearly identify the location of the stable and unstable manifolds and the NHIM at the intersection of the invariant manifolds. Since we are using a small integration time of $\\tau = 10$ to compute LDs, the complete geometry of the homoclinic tangle is not fully revealed. Therefore, in order to recover a more complete and intricate dynamical picture of the homoclinic tangle, the integration time to compute LDs has to be increased. This is shown in Fig. [fig:8](#fig:ps_vs_ld_2)B), where $\\tau = 30$ and we observe that the regular motion obtained in the middle of the Poincar\\'e section displayed in Fig. [fig:8](#fig:ps_vs_ld_2) A) corresponds to trajectories that remain trapped in the potential well region and never escape. The trapped dynamics on the tori are also captured by the LD contour map shown in Fig. [fig:8](#fig:ps_vs_ld_2)B) which also reveals the homoclinic tangle of the stable and unstable manifolds and the resulting lobe dynamics {% cite beigie1992 --file HamSN %}. We note that in all these computations we are using the variable time definition of LDs, since the open potential surface causes trajectories to escape to infinity through the bottleneck in finite time, resulting in NaN values in the LD contour map and would hide the important underlying phase space structures making the interpretation of results difficult. In addition, when we analyze the dynamics using Poincar\\'e sections, we cannot ensure that trajectories return to the surface of section when the dynamical behavior of escaping to infinity is possible in the system. This will result in blank regions in the Poincar\\'e sections as shown in Fig. [fig:8](#fig:ps_vs_ld_2)A) and C). However, we note that trapped trajectories in the potential well corresponding to regular (motion on the tori) and chaotic motion are highlighted as expected in the Poincar\\'e sections. These trajectories are non-reactive and will remain so until they satisfy the _sufficient_ condition for reaction which is entering the cylindrical manifolds. "

    "Identifying the regions inside the cylindrical (tube) stable and unstable manifolds can be done using globalization or using the LD contour map on appropriate isoenergetic surfaces. We compute LD contour maps to recover the intersections of these tube manifolds with the surface of section in Eq. \\eqref{eq:sosxpx}. The intersection of the invariant manifolds with the isoenergetic surface of section yields topological ellipses, known in the chemical reactions literature as _reactive islands_ {% cite deleon1991a deleon1991b deleon1992 patra2018detecting --file HamSN %} which are of paramount importance for the computation of reaction rates/fraction. In order to illustrate the capability of LDs to recover the reactive island structure, we have compared the LD contour map and manifold intersection with the surface of section $\\mathcal{U}^{+}_{xp_x}$ obtained using globalization in Fig. [fig:9](#fig:LDManifolds). We have shown the first intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds with the surface of section as a blue/red curve superimposed on the LD contour map. We observe that the points at which the LDs scalar field is non-differentiable and the manifolds intersections are in agreement, thus verifying the LD based identification of reactive islands. We also observe that successive folds and resulting intersections of the tube manifolds with the surface of section are also revealed by LDs. We note here that the first intersection of the manifolds encloses a large phase space volume in the potential well which indicates that a large portion of the potential well escapes to infinity through the bottleneck. This is despite the fact that we have chosen a very small value for the energy of the system, $H_0 = 0.05$, compared to the energy of the barrier. This is a consequence of using a high coupling strength, $\\varepsilon = 0.25$, which makes the vase-like shaped potential well region small and narrow, since the center equilibrium point at the bottom of the potential well approaches the index-1 saddle equilibrium point at the origin as $\\varepsilon$ is increased. Movies illustrating the change in both the shape of the energy surface and the equipotentials in configurations space as we vary the coupling strength can be found at the links https://youtu.be/kYklCrSwtls and https://youtu.be/0FNChWVM6nU respectively. We can see that the effect of increasing the coupling strength from zero is to _tilt and squeeze_ the vase-like shape of the energy surface that qualitatively increases the number of reactive trajectories. This action of tilting and squeezing of the vase-like container (boundary defined by the total energy surface) is to pour out its contents (the reactive trajectories) and hence the increase in reaction fraction. A quantitative investigation of this phenomenon is current work in progress and beyond the scope of this chapter."
