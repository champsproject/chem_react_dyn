    "Potential wells of a PES correspond to center-stability equilibrium points of the Hamiltonian, and are characterized by the fact that the Hessian matrix of the PES evaluated at these critical points, denoted by $\\text{Hess}_V$, has a pair of real and positive eigenvalues. This results in the Jacobian of the linearization having two pairs of complex (and purely imaginary) eigenvalues, which yields quasiperiodic motion in their neighborhood. In the context of chemical reaction dynamics, potential wells correspond to stable isomer configurations of the molecule under study. On the other hand, index-1 saddles of the PES are identified with saddle points of the potential energy landscape, and the associated phase space equilibrium point is of saddle-center stability type. This means that $\\text{Hess}_V$ has two real eigenvalues of different sign, which is equivalent to the Jacobian having a pair of real eigenvalues of opposite sign and a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues. Geometrically, an index-1 saddle is a local maximum in one direction and a local minimum in a perpendicular direction, as seen in the normal coordinates associated to the eigenvectors. Moreover, the eigenvector pointing in the maximum direction can be taken as a local approximation to define the reaction coordinate.(REF) The role that the index-1 saddles have in the model PES for isomerization that we  consider is to connect pairs of wells, and therefore, they control access of phase space trajectories from well to well. From the perspective of chemical reactions, index-1 saddles are identified with transition state configurations of the given molecule, and, as we will see shortly, the phase space structures they give rise to are essential for the accurate computation of chemical reaction rates. Finally, index-2 saddles of a two-dimensional PES have the geometrical shape of a local maximum, i.e. a 'hilltop', which is characterized by the fact that the Hessian of the PES has two real and negative eigenvalues. This implies that when we linearize Hamilton's equations about this type of equilibrium point, the Jacobian yields two pairs of real eigenvalues, each pair having opposite signs. Thus, their stability is of saddle-saddle type, which has the dynamical effect of deflecting incoming trajectories in the neighborhood of an index-2 saddle at an exponential rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is important to define what we mean for a trajectory to be trapped in one of the wells of the PES. From the energy landscape displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:PES_isom_rout}, this concept can be determined by studying the change in the sign of the configuration coordinates $x$ or $y$. For example, if we focus on the lower-left well, we can say that a trajectory is trapped in that well when the configuration coordinates of both $x$ and $y$ DoF remain negative during its evolution. Moreover, in this setup we can identify *reactive* trajectories as those that move from one well to another along their evolution. Since we are dealing in this case with a symmetric PES with respect to the origin, and there is one well in each quadrant, reaction would imply a change in the sign of one of the configuration coordinates of the trajectory. Notice that two types of reactive trajectories are possible when considering an initial condition starting on the lower-left well whose potential destination is the upper-right well. First, we could have sequential isomerization which implies transition from the lower-left well to an adjacent well through the phase space bottleneck region in the neighborhood of the index-1 saddle point that sits between both wells. This situation is only possible given that the system has enough energy to surmount the energy barrier (the energy of the index-1 saddle). A second alternative for reaching the upper-right well from the lower-left well is that trajectories cross directly through the index-2 saddle located at the origin (the hilltop of the PES), which is known as concerted isomerization. For an illustration of these two isomerization processes refer to Fig. \\ref{fig:PES_isom_rout}.\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe next the isomerization dynamics for the symmetric and uncoupled Hamiltonian system in terms of the phase space geometrical structures associated to the index-1 and index-2 saddles present in the model PES. We begin our discussion by fixing a value for the total energy of the system $H_0$. As we have mentioned earlier, this energy is distributed among both DoF, so that we can write $H_0 = H_{x,0} + H_{y,0}$ where $H_{x,0} $ and $H_{y,0}$ are the energies in the $x$ and $y$ DoFs respectively. We discuss some of the different cases in terms of the energy below: \n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Energy Level** $(-1/2 \\leq H_0 \\leq -1/4)$: For this case the wells of the PES are isolated from each other since the energy of the system is below that of the index-1 saddles that interconnect the wells. Therefore, motion of an initial condition that starts in one of the wells will remain trapped in that well forever, displaying librational quasiperiodic motion.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "-  **Energy Level** $(-1/4 < H_0 \\leq 0)$: In this situation the energy is above that of any of the index-1 saddles in the PES, but below the energy of the index-2 saddle at the origin. Therefore, all potential wells are connected and isomerization can take place. This allows the transit of trajectories from well to well through the phase space bottlenecks that open in the neigborhood of the equilibrium points associated to index-1 saddles. However, the index-2 saddle region of the PES is energetically forbidden, and hence, only sequential isomerization is allowed. Given that the system is completely symmetric in this case, in order to describe the phase space structures that govern isomerization dynamics and characterize the bottleneck regions in the vicinity of the index-1 saddles of the PES, we focus our analysis on the equilibrium point $(0,\\sqrt{2}/2,0,0)$ associated to the upper index-1 saddle, separating the upper-left and upper-right wells. This stationary point has saddle-center stability."

    "So far we have discussed the nature of the trajectories for all the different cases of positive and negative total energy of the system. At this point we will explore the dynamics revealed by the Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) for the same cases of the total energy and conclude that the LDs recovers the same phase space as in Fig. \\ref{fig:phasePort_1DoF_symm}. In Fig. \\ref{fig:LD_sym_h_neg} we have calculated the LDs using a small integration time $\\tau = 5$, for the phase space slice $y = -1/\\sqrt{2}$ and for total energy $H = -0.2$. This energy is above the energy of all four index-1 saddles and below the energy of the index-2 saddle. Therefore all the wells of the potential are connected and reaction can take place by crossing the open bottleneck, which is the NHIM (UPO) and its stable and unstable manifolds (spherical cylinders) that coincide in this case, and passing from the $x>0$ to $x<0$ (or from $y>0$ to $y<0$ or vice versa) or vice versa. So these geometrical structures act as a 'reactive highway' allowing the system to transit from well to well which would correspond to a given molecule undergoing an isomerization reaction. Remember that since the chosen energy is below the energy of the index-2 saddle but above the energy of all four index-1 saddles  this means that we can have sequential isomerization but the region in the neighborhood of the index-2 saddle is forbidden and hence the system cannot exhibit concerted isomerization. In particular in Fig. \\ref{fig:LD_sym_h_neg} (A) we can notice that the spherical cylinders of the left and right index-1 saddles do not intersect with the cylinders of the bottom index-1 saddle and that the phase space consists of three regions: 1) the spherical cylinder of the index-1 in the right, where if we pick an initial condition inside this region the trajectory, in the configuration space, will be reactive and it will move through the bottleneck (UPO), corresponding to the right index-1, back and forth between the lower-right and upper-right wells (magenta). This is because the y-coordinate change sign while the x-coordinate doesn't. We are outside of the separatrix in the $y-p_{y}$ plane and the trajectory is periodic. On the other hand we are inside the separatrix in the $x-p_{x}$ plane and hence the trajectory doesn't change sign in this direction. We should mention here that the boundary of the cylinders is the boundary of the energy. 2) The spherical cylinder of the index-1 on the bottom, where if we pick any initial condition inside this cylinder the trajectory will be reactive and it move through the bottleneck (UPO), corresponding to the bottom index-1, back and forth between the lower-right and lower-left wells (red). This is because the x-coordinate change sign while the y-coordinate doesn't. We are outside of the separatrix in the $x-p_{x}$ plane and the trajectory is periodic. On the other hand we are inside the separatrix in the $y-p_{y}$ plane and hence the trajectory doesn't change sign in this direction. 3) The region inside the homoclinic curve, where if we pick an initial condition inside this region the trajectory will be trapped in the well (cyan) and they will never escape. In this case both the trajectories are inside the separatrix and hence non of them change sign. To summarize in this case, that the system is uncoupled, the stable and unstable manifolds of the UPOs of the index-1 saddles of the PES do not give rise to heteroclinic intersections, so that the dynamics of the system remains trapped in the lower-left well or it can exhibit sequential isomerization to the lower-right or upper-right well.\n",

Hence the cylinders determine the initial conditions that can pass through the bottleneck as they evolve in time.  The method of LDs also detects the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of all the index-1 saddles that are normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs). The method of LDs recovers all the phase space structures that we described above. "

In this case the PES has four minima (wells), four index-1 saddles and one index-2 saddle point ('hilltop'), notice that the location of the critical points is different than the symmetric case and the index-2 saddle is not at the begging of the axis (0,0) anymore. Another difference between this case and the symmetric one, is that the energies have changed and the index-1 saddles don't have equal energies anymore. When $\\delta = \\delta_{c}$ (second row) the PES has 6 critical points, we can see the creation of a cusp and the three critical points in the middle of the panel B have collide simultaneously, saddle node bifurcations, with the three critical points on the left of the panel B.

    "In Fig. \\ref{fig:LD_delta_02} we calculate LDs for the fixed value of the asymmetric parameter $\\delta = 0.2$ and for different energies. In particular in this figure we have calculated LDs for an integration time of $\\tau = 5$ in the phase space slice $y = -1/\\sqrt{2}$. We discuss the phase space structures for different energy values. For instance, in Fig. \\ref{fig:LD_delta_02} A) we use an energy value of $H = -0.2$ which is below the energy of the left index-1 saddle and below the energy of the index-2 saddle. Hence, the bottleneck that connects the lower-left and upper-right wells is still closed. The only option for trajectories that start on the lower-left well is to be trapped in that well or to evolve to the lower-right well by crossing the bottom index-1 saddle. In panel B) we use an energy of $H=-0.1$ which is above the energy of the left index-1 and still below the energy of index-2 saddle. In this case trajectories starting on the lower-left well have three different types of motion. They can be trapped in the well forever, or they can move to the lower-right or upper-left wells, since the phase space bottleneck connecting the wells is now open. Therefore,       trajectories can move between the wells and the system would show  sequential isomerization.\n",

The magenta curve represents the energy boundary. For this value of $\\delta$, that is the critical value, the three simultaneous saddle-node bifurcations have just occur and there are four wells and two index-1 saddles left. A) The energy of the system is $H = -1/6$ and corresponds to the phase space slice $y = -1/\\sqrt{2}$. In this case we have two regions. One inside the spherical cylinder of the index-1 in the right and one outside of this cylinder, where is the trapping area. B) The phase space slide $p_x = 0$ where it is clear how the initial conditions that we pick up in A get evolve. The trajectory of any initial condition inside the spherical cylinder of index-1 (red) will remain inside the cylinder and move between the lower and upper wells in comparison to any trajectory starting outside of the cylinder will remain trapped in the well (blue), the coordinates don't change sign. C) The energy of the system is $H = -1/12$ and corresponds to the phase space slice $y = -1/\\sqrt{2}$. In this case there are three regions. One inside the spherical cylinder of index-1, one area in the spherical cylinder of the parabolic point that is in the line of $x = x_{c}$ and one area outside of this. D) The phase space slide $p_y = 0$. Here we can see how the initial conditions from panel C get evolve. The trajectory inside the parabolic spherical cylinder (cyan) will remain inside the cylinder, horizontal trapped motion. The initial condition (red) is trapping in the well.
