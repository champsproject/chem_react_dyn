    "One of the biggest challenges of dynamical systems theory or nonlinear dynamics is the development of mathematical techniques that provide us with the capability of exploring the geometrical template of structures that governs transport in phase space. Since the early 1900, the idea of pursuing a qualitative description of the solutions of differential equations, which emerged from the pioneering work carried out by Henri Poincaré on the three body problem of celestial mechanics {% cite hp1890 --file LDs %}, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the nonlinear character of natural phenomena. Indeed, this powerful approach has now been widely embraced by the scientific community and its essence was nicely captured by Vladimir Arnold's statement that a complete description of classical mechanics boils down to the geometrical analysis of phase space. \n",

    "In this section we present the details of a mathematical tool whose potential brings us  one step closer to fulfilling the long sought after dream envisioned by Poincaré. The method is known in the literature as Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) and has the capability of revealing the geometrical template of phase space structures that characterizes trajectories with qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. As we will see, this method provides us with a systematic way of exploring phase space by means of looking at its dynamical skeleton using low-dimensional slices. This procedure allows for a complete reconstruction, that is, a *phase space tomography*, of the intricate geometry of underlying invariant manifolds that characterize transport mechanisms.\n",

    "where the vector field satifies $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t) \\in C^{r} (r \\geq 1)$ in $\\mathbf{x}$ and continuous in time. If the vector field does not depend on time, the system is called *autonomous*, and it is *non-autonomous* otherwise. For any initial condition $\\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0$ this system of differential equations has a unique solution with the same regularity as that of the vector field, which also depends continuously on the initial data {% cite coddington1984 --file LDs %}. The vector field can be specified as an analytical model, or it could also have been retrieved from numerical simulations as a discrete spatio-temporal dataset.\n",

    "The method of Lagrangian Descriptors was first introduced to analyze Lagrangian transport and mixing in geophysical flows {% cite madrid2009 mendoza2010 --file LDs %}. Initially, LDs relied on the arclength of the trajectories as they evolve from their initial conditions forward and backward in time {% cite mendoza2010 mancho2013lagrangian --file LDs %}. Since its proposal as a nonlinear dynamics tool, it was used to plan a transoceanic autonomous underwater vehicle missions {% cite ramos2018 --file LDs %}, manage marine oil spills {% cite gg2016 --file LDs %}, analyze the Stratospheric Polar Vortex {% cite alvaro1 alvaro2 curbelo2019a curbelo2019b --file LDs %}, and recently in chemical reaction dynamics {% cite craven2015lagrangian craven2016deconstructing craven2017lagrangian revuelta2019unveiling --file LDs %}.\n",

    "Our goal in this section is to give an introduction to the method of Lagrangian descriptors, which can reveal the geometry of phase space structures that determine transport in dynamical systems, such as in Eq. \\eqref{eq:gtp_dynSys}. The geometry of phase space structures is encoded in the trajectories of the system, which can be extracted using LDs from their initial conditions. The simple idea behind LDs is to seed a given phase space region with initial conditions and integrate a bounded and positive quantity (an intrinsic geometrical and/or physical property of the dynamical system under study) along trajectories for a finite time. This approach reveals the invariant phase space structures that make up the dynamical skeleton governing reaction dynamics. This is similar to the visualization techniques developed in fluid mechanics experiments in the laboratory to uncover patterns of flow structures by studying the evolution of particles in a moving fluid {% cite chien1986 --file LDs %}.

    "One of the biggest challenges that one is faced with when exploring the high-dimensional phase space of a dynamical system, such as those that occur in Hamiltonian systems, is that of the qualitative description of the behavior of ensembles of initial conditions, and recovering from their trajectory evolution the underlying template of geometrical phase space structures that governs the dynamical transport mechanisms of the flow. The problem that naturally arises in this context is that the trajectories of ensembles of initial conditions that start nearby might get ''lost'' with respect to each other very quickly, making the use of classical nonlinear dynamics techniques (Small Alignment Index, Lyapunov Exponents, etc...) that rely on tracking the location of neighboring trajectories computationally expensive and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, when Poincaré maps are applied for the dynamical analysis of high-dimensional systems, one might encounter the issue of trajectories not coming back to the selected surface of section, which would yield no relevant information whatsoever. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of Lagrangian descriptors provides tremendous advantages in comparison to other methodologies to overcome these issues. For instance, it is a computationally inexpensive and straightforward to implement tool to explore nonlinear dynamics. But probably, the key and revolutionary idea behind the success of this technique is that it focuses on integrating a positive scalar function along trajectories of initial conditions of the system instead of tracking their phase space location. In this way, by emphasizing initial conditions, it directly targets the building blocks where the dynamical structure of phase space is encoded. The methodology offered by LDs has thus the capability of producing a complete and detailed geometrical *phase space tomography* in high dimensions by means of using low-dimensional phase space probes to extract the intersections of the phase space invariant manifolds with these slices {% cite demian2017 naik2019a naik2019b GG2019 --file LDs %}. Any phase space slice can be selected and sampled with a high-resolution grid of initial conditions, and no information regarding the dynamical skeleton af invariant manifolds at the given slice is lost as the trajectories evolve in time. Moreover, this analysis does not rely on trajectories coming back to the chosen slice, as is required for Ponicaré maps to work. In this respect, there is also another key point that needs to be highlighted which demonstrates the real potential of LDs with respect to other classical nonlinear dynamics techniques. Using LDs we can obtain *all* the invariant manifolds of the dynamical system *simultaneously*, the hyperbolic stable and unstable manifolds coming from *any* NHIM in phase space, and also the KAM tori. This provides an edge over the classical approach of computing stable and unstable manifolds that relies on locating first the NHIMs in phase space individually, and for every NHIM globalize the manifolds separately, for which a knowledge of the eigendirections is crucial. Consequently, the application of LDs offers the capability of recovering *all* the relevant phase space structures in one *shot* without having to study the local dynamics about equilibrium points of the dynamical system."

    "At this point, we would like to discuss the issues that arise from the definitions of LDs provided in Eqs. \\eqref{eq:M_function} and \\eqref{eq:Mp_function} when they are applied to analyze dynamics in open Hamiltonian systems. Notice that in both definitions all the initial conditions are integrated for the same time $\\tau$. Recent studies have revealed  {% cite junginger2017chemical naik2019b GG2019 --file LDs %} that computing fixed-time LDs, that is, integrating all initial conditions chosen on a phase space surface for the same integration time $\\tau$, could give rise to issues related to the fact that some of the trajectories that escape from the potential energy surface can go to infinity in finite time or at an increasing rate. The trajectories that show this behavior will give NaN values in the LD scalar field, hiding some regions of the phase space, and therefore obscuring the detection of invariant manifolds. In order to circumvent this problem we explain here the approach that has been recently adopted in the literature {% cite junginger2017chemical naik2019b GG2019 --file LDs %} known as variable integration time Lagrangian descriptors.

Therefore, the total integration time in this strategy depends on the initial conditions themselves, that is $\\tau(\\mathbf{x}_0)$.

For this small integration time, the method highlights the saddle and center fixed points, since the arclength at those points is always zero. Moreover, in this case the phase portrait still looks blurry as shown in Fig. [fig:2](#fig:duffing1_lds) A), and this is a consequence of trajectories not having sufficient time to evolve in order to make distinct dynamical behaviors ditinguishable. If we now increase the integration time to $\\tau = 10$, we can see in Fig. [fig:2](#fig:duffing1_lds) B) that the homoclinic connection formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at the origin becomes clearly visible. Moreover, observe that the manifolds are located at points where the scalar values taken by LDs change abruptly. This property is demonstrated in Fig. [fig:2](#fig:duffing1_lds) C), where we have depicted the value of function $M$ along the line $y = 0.5$. Notice that sharp changes in the scalar field of LDs at the manifolds are also related to local minima."

    "Once we have fixed the surfaces of section (SOS) where we want to compute LDs, we select a grid of initial conditions and, after discarding those that are energetically unfeasible, we integrate the remaining conditions both forward and backward in time, and compute LDs using the definition in Eq. \\eqref{eq:Mp_vt} with $p = 1/2$ along the trajectory for the whole fixed integration time or until the initial condition leaves the interaction region $\\mathcal{R}$, what happens first. The result obtained when the LDs values are plotted will reveal the stable and unstable manifolds and also de KAM tori in the surface of section under consideration. Since the stable and unstable manifolds are detected at points where the LD scalar function is non-differentiable, we can directly extract them from the gradient, that is, using $||\\nabla \\mathcal{M}_p||$. We begin by looking at the phase space structures on the SOS $\\mathcal{U}^{+}_{y,p_y}$. To do so, we fix an energy for the system $H = 1/12$, which is below that of the saddle-center equilibrium points. For that energy level, the exit channels of the PES are closed, and therefore, all trajectories are trapped in the scattering region of the central minimum at the origin. We can clearly see in Fig. [fig:6](#fig:henonHeiles_lds) A)-B) that the computation of the $p$-norm variable integration time LDs with $p = 1/2$ using $\\tau = 50$ reveals that the motion of the system is completely regular. The method nicely captures the UPO present in the central region of the PES and also its stable and unstable manifolds which form a homoclininc cnnection. In order to demonstrate how the intricate details of chaotic motion are captured by LDs, we increase the energy of the system to $H = 1/3$. This energy level is now above that of the index-1 saddles of the PES, and consequently, phase space bottlenecks open in the energy manifold allowing trajectories of the system to escape to infinity from the scattering region. When we apply LDs using $\\tau = 10$ on the SOSs defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq:psos}, we observe in Figs. [fig:6](#fig:henonHeiles_lds) C)-F) that we can detect with high-fidelity the intricate homoclinic tangle formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the UPO associated to the upper index-1 saddle of the PES. Moreover, observe that despite the issue of trajectories escaping to infinity in finite time, LDs succeed in revealing the template of geometrical phase space structures that governs transport and escape dynamics from the PES of the H\\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian system."
