@article{Uzer2002,
	Abstract = {The geometrical structures which regulate transformations in dynamical systems with three or more degrees of freedom (DOFs) form the subject of this paper. Our treatment focuses on the (2 n -3)-dimensional normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) in n DOF systems associated with a centre ×···× centre × saddle in the phase space flow in the (2 n -1)-dimensional energy surface. The NHIM bounds a (2 n -2)-dimensional surface, called a `transition state' (TS) in chemical reaction dynamics, which partitions the energy surface into volumes characterized as `before' and `after' the transformation. This surface is the long-sought momentum-dependent TS beyond two DOFs. The (2 n -2)-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds associated with the (2 n -3)-dimensional NHIM are impenetrable barriers with the topology of multidimensional spherical cylinders. The phase flow interior to these spherical cylinders passes through the TS as the system undergoes its transformation. The phase flow exterior to these spherical cylinders is directed away from the TS and, consequently, will never undergo the transition. The explicit forms of these phase space barriers can be evaluated using normal form theory. Our treatment has the advantage of supplying a practical algorithm, and we demonstrate its use on a strongly coupled nonlinear Hamiltonian, the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields.},

We specifically emphasize the notion of a NHIM as a ``phase space concept''. In particular, we make the observation that the (phase space) NHIM plays the role of ``carrying'' the (configuration space) properties of a saddle point of the potential energy surface into phase space.},

We perform a reduction (analogous to that in rigid body dynamics) after which the problem reduces to analysis of a two-degree-of-freedom system. In the general case, in canonical variables the Hamiltonian does not correspond to any natural mechanical system. In addition, in the general case, the absence of an analytic additional integral follows from the constructed Poincar{\'e} section. We also give a review of the historical development of celestial mechanics in spaces of constant curvature and formulate open problems.},

abstract = "The Transition State dividing surface is a key concept, not only for the precise calculation of the rate constant of a reaction, but also for the proper prediction of product ratios. The correct location of this surface is defined by the requirement that reactive trajectories do not recross it. In the case of reactions in solution the solvent plays an important role in the location of the dividing surface. In this paper we show with the aid of a model Hamiltonian that the effective mass of the solvent can dramatically change the location of the dividing surface."

    abstract = { This paper provides a theoretical background for Lagrangian Descriptors (LDs). The goal of achieving rigorous proofs that justify the ability of LDs to detect invariant manifolds is simplified by introducing an alternative definition for LDs. The definition is stated for n-dimensional systems with general time dependence, however we rigorously prove that this method reveals the stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points in four particular 2D cases: a hyperbolic saddle point for linear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for linear nonautonomous systems and a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear nonautonomous systems. We also discuss further rigorous results which show the ability of LDs to highlight additional invariants sets, such as n-tori. These results are just a simple extension of the ergodic partition theory which we illustrate by applying this methodology to well-known examples, such as the planar field of the harmonic oscillator and the 3D ABC flow. Finally, we provide a thorough discussion on the requirement of the objectivity (frame-invariance) property for tools designed to reveal phase space structures and their implications for Lagrangian descriptors. }

Recently it has been shown (Wiggins et al (2001) Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 5478; Uzer et al (2002) Nonlinearity 15 957) how to construct a dividing surface in phase space for Hamiltonian systems with an arbitrary (finite) number of degrees of freedom having the property that trajectories only cross once locally. In this letter we provide an argument showing that the flux across this dividing surface is a minimum with respect to certain types of variations of the dividing surface.}
