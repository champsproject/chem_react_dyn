    "In this chapter, we analyse the phase space structure of the roaming dynamics in a two degree of freedom potential energy surface consisting of two identical planar Morse potentials separated by a distance. This potential energy surface was previously studied in \\cite{carpenter2018dynamics}, and it has two potential wells surrounded by an unbounded flat region containing no critical points. We study the phase space mechanism for the transference between the wells using the method of Lagrangian descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The roaming mechanism for chemical reactions was reported in \\cite{townsend2004roaming}. This paper inspired and motivated further work on the topic that is continuing. Some recent reviews of the topic are  \\cite{Bowman2011Suits, Bowman2011roaming, BowmanRoaming, suits2008, Mauguiere2017}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following \\cite{carpenter2018dynamics}, a concise description of the roaming mechanism that seems to capture all such reactive phenomena attributed to roaming to date is the following. An energised molecule, which appears on the verge of dissociating into two fragments, instead exhibits behaviour where one fragment begins to rotate about the other in the flat region of the potential energy surface, culminating in the two fragments re-encountering each other in a reactive event. This reactive event may be constitutionally identical to one for which a familiar transition state associated with an index one saddle can be identified, but the roaming reaction path is observed to avoid the intrinsic reaction path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The double Morse potential energy surface allows us to analyse key feature of the reaction dynamics which appear to underlay roaming mechanism. In particular, the double Morse has a flat roaming region where it can be rigorously proven that there are no saddle points. For explaining reaction mechanisms in the context of the potential energy surface index one saddles have been a fundamental building block. This has motivated efforts to locate index one saddle points that can be attributed as the mechanism for roaming (roaming saddles).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the work in \\cite{carpenter2018dynamics} showed that roaming mechanism in the double Morse potential occurs without the influence of saddle points. In particular, it was demonstrated that roaming was governed by phase space structures governing dynamics in the flat region of the potential energy surface. These phase space structures are normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) \\cite{wiggins_book1994,Wiggins2001,Uzer2002, Wiggins08,Wiggins2016}, which in the case of 2 DoF Hamiltonian systems are unstable periodic orbits \\cite{Mauguiere2015}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue of interest in \\cite{carpenter2018dynamics} was the motion of trajectories between the two wells and the intermediary dynamics in the flat region. It was conjectured that three types of unstable periodic orbits mediated the dynamics. The description of roaming given in \\cite{carpenter2018dynamics} was based on the behaviour of trajectories initiated on periodic orbit dividing surfaces associated with the three types of periodic orbits. The trajectory behaviour confirmed the conjecture. However, this work did not examine the phase space structures that determine the different types of trajectory behaviour. Such an analysis would involve an understanding of the geometry of the stable and unstable manifolds of the periodic orbits in phase space, similar in spirit to the analysis that has been carried out in \\cite{krajvnak2018phase, krajvnak2018influence}. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will determine the phase space pathways for the roaming mechanism in the double Morse oscillator using the method of Lagrangian descriptors. Lagrangian descriptors are a trajectory diagnostic that has proven useful for revealing phase space structures in dynamical systems.  The method was originally developed to reveal fluid flow structures in Lagrangian transport problems (hence the name Lagrangian descriptors) \\cite{chaos}.  However, in recent years, the ease of implementation and interpretation of the method has applied in fields far beyond fluid mechanics. In particular, in theoretical chemistry the method has seen a diverse collection of applications to problems in chemical reaction dynamics in recent years, see, e.g., \\cite{patra2018detecting, craven2016deconstructing, craven2017lagrangian, craven2015lagrangian, junginger2016transition, revuelta2017transition, junginger2017chemical, feldmaier2017obtaining, JH2015}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method facilitates a high-resolution approach for exploring high dimensional phase space with low dimensional sets.  It can also be applied to both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian systems \\cite{lopesino2017} as well as to systems with arbitrary, even stochastic, time-dependence \\cite{balibrea2016lagrangian}. Moreover, Lagrangian descriptors can be applied directly to trajectory data sets, without the need for an explicit dynamical system \\cite{mmw14}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical Lagrangian descriptor field is computed by selecting a region of phase space and then choosing a grid of initial conditions for trajectories in this set. Points in the set are assigned a value according to the arc length of the trajectory starting at that initial condition after integration for a fixed, finite time, both backward and forward in time (all initial conditions in the grid are integrated for the same time). The idea underlying Lagrangian descriptors is that the influence of phase space structures on trajectories will result in differences in arc length of nearby trajectories. This has been verified and quantified in terms of the notion of singular structures in the Lagrangian descriptor fields, which are easy to recognise visually \\cite{ cnsns, lopesino2017}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trajectories are the elementary objects that are used to explore phase space.  In fact, phase space structure is built from trajectories and their behaviour. For high dimensional phase space this approach is problematic and prone to issues of interpretation since a tightly grouped set of initial conditions may result in trajectories that become far with respect to each other in high dimensional phase space. The method of Lagrangian descriptors takes a new and different approach by encoding the phase space structure in the initial conditions of trajectories, rather than the precise location of their futures and pasts (after a specified amount of time). Hence, a low dimensional set of phase space can be selected and sampled with a grid of initial conditions of high resolution. Since the phase space structure is encoded in the initial conditions of the trajectories, no resolution in the chosen slice of phase space is lost as the trajectories evolve in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is outlined as follows. In section \\ref{sec:DMPES}, we recall the main features of the double Morse potential energy surface and resulting Hamiltonian system as described in \\cite{carpenter2018dynamics} that are relevant to our analysis.  In section \\ref{sec:config}, we define the features of the double Morse potential energy surface that are relevant to our analysis.  In Section \\ref{sec:LD} we describe Lagrangian descriptors. In section \\ref{sec:PO}, we show how Lagrangian descriptors can be used to compute periodic orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds. In section \\ref{sec:roaming}, we describe the phase space pathways for roaming using the stable and unstable manifolds of the periodic orbits. \n"

The Lagrangian descriptor in Fig. \\ref{fig:LD_time} with $\\tau_{-} = -\\tau_+$ evaluated on this line is identically zero due to the symmetries of the system. For this reason, is convenient to consider the Lagrangian descriptor with $\\tau_{-} = 0$ and $\\tau_+ > 0$, the results are in the Fig. \\ref{fig:LD_line_x0}. When the integration time $\\tau_+$ is increased enough, the peak generated for the different behaviour of the trajectories reveals the intersections of the stable manifold of the periodic orbit with the $x_0$ axis. Due to the symmetry of the stable and unstable manifolds respect to the $x_0$ axis, this intersection coincides with the intersection with the unstable manifold of the periodic orbit. Finally, the intersection point between the stable and unstable manifolds is the intersection with the periodic orbit with the $x_0$ axis. It is important to notice that the integration time to generate the peak is different from the period of the orbit. \n",

This fact is a consequence of the time-reversal invariance of the system. The second property is that the periodic orbits used to construct the dividing surface are the boundaries between the regions where the trajectories enter into the phase space region contained by the dividing surface and trajectories that left the same region. The third property, the flux through the dividing surface is minimal. That means, if the dividing surface is deformed, the flux through it increases.

The extremes of the projection are the returning points where the periodic orbit has zero momentum. The dividing surface, in this case, is a surface genus 0 (topologically equivalent to a sphere). An example of this kind of periodic orbits and their respective dividing surface is in \\cite{Rafa2019}.\n",

A fate map shows the origin and destiny of the trajectories, considering the evolution for an interval of time. In this case, the origin and destiny of the trajectories are the regions $A$, $B$, and $C$ defined in the previous section. The procedure to calculate the fate map on a dividing surface is the following: consider a point on the dividing surface, integrate forward and backwards the trajectory that crosses this point on the dividing surface until each extreme of the trajectory reaches one of the three regions, and label this point with the corresponding fate. The left side of Fig. \\ref{fig:FM_LD} show the fate map for each dividing surface. Each different colour in the fate map indicates different transport between regions $A$, $B$, and $C$. The fate maps evaluated on the dividing surfaces of the periodic orbits $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$ have all nine possibilities of transport between the regions $A$, $B$, and $C$.

The same segments of the trajectories are used to calculate the Lagrangian descriptors and the fate maps. Like in the calculation of the fate maps, the values of $\\tau_-$ and $\\tau_+$ for each trajectory are the times necessary to reach one of the three regions.

These are trajectories associated with dissociation. The yellow regions correspond to trajectories that start in the asymptotic region, cross the dividing surfaces, and finally reach a potential well. The regions with mixed colours in the Lagrangian descriptor plot without abrupt changes are associated with the trajectories that connect the two wells.
