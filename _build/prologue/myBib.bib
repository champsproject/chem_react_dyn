   Pages = {3530-3557},
   Abstract = {In this paper we develop new techniques for revealing geometrical structures in phase space that are valid for aperiodically time dependent dynamical systems, which we refer to as Lagrangian descriptors. These quantities are based on the integration, for a finite time, along trajectories of an intrinsic bounded, positive geometrical and/or physical property of the trajectory itself. We discuss a general methodology for constructing Lagrangian descriptors, and we discuss a “heuristic argument” that explains why this method is successful for revealing geometrical structures in the phase space of a dynamical system. We support this argument by explicit calculations on a benchmark problem having a hyperbolic fixed point with stable and unstable manifolds that are known analytically. Several other benchmark examples are considered that allow us the assess the performance of Lagrangian descriptors in revealing invariant tori and regions of shear. Throughout the paper “side-by-side” comparisons of the performance of Lagrangian descriptors with both finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and finite time averages of certain components of the vector field (“time averages”) are carried out and discussed. In all cases Lagrangian descriptors are shown to be both more accurate and computationally efficient than these methods. We also perform computations for an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically time-dependent vector field and an aperiodically time dependent vector field defined as a data set. Comparisons with FTLEs and time averages for these examples are also carried out, with similar conclusions as for the benchmark examples.},

The correct location of this surface is defined by the requirement that reactive trajectories do not recross it. In the case of reactions in solution the solvent plays an important role in the location of the dividing surface. In this paper we show with the aid of a model Hamiltonian that the effective mass of the solvent can dramatically change the location of the dividing surface.},

The expansion is triggered by the strong repulsion between the solute and its neighboring solvents, originally inside the cage. This intermediate mechanism is found to be the cause for the bump following the ultrafast decay in the solvation time correlation functions of the `epsilon' model at low densities.},

Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were implemented to derive a new isotropic NO A(3sσ)–Ar pair potential which was further used to investigate the role of local density enhancements on the solvation process by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. These density inhomogeneities were found to have no influence on the solvation dynamics. Furthermore, the latter was shown to take place in a strongly non-linear regime, especially at low temperatures. This process results from the dramatic change of solute–solvent short range interaction associated with the large solute size change upon excitation to the Rydberg state.},

   Journal = {Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.},
   Volume = {17},

   Pages = {8372-8381},
   Abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations are reported for the deazetisation and ring opening of meso-2,3-difluoro-2,3-dimethyldiazocyclopropane in three solvents: CHCl3, CHFClBr and CH3CH(OH)CF3 (TFIPA). The achiral reactant leads to enantiomeric allene products, and the question addressed in the study is whether either of the chiral, enantiomerically pure solvents can induce significant enantiomeric excess in the products. The direct dynamics calculations use an empirical valence bond potential for the solute, with empirical parameters optimised against M06-2X/cc-pVTZ density functional results. The results reveal that the exothermic N2 loss and ring opening promote transient strong solvent-solute interactions within the first [similar]100 fs of the reaction. Because of the bifurcating reaction path, these interactions occur at time when the "decision" about which enantiomer of the product to form has yet to be made (at least for many of the trajectories). Hence, it is possible in principle that the solvent could exert a larger-than-normal influence on the course of the reaction. In fact, the results reveal no such effect for CHFClBr but do predict that TFIPA should induce 15.2 +/- 2.1% enantiomeric excess. This is roughly an order of magnitude larger than solvent-induced enantiomeric excesses found experimentally in reactions where the conversion of reactant(s) to enantiomeric products occur over separate transition states.},

   Abstract = {We develop Wigner's approach to a dynamical transition state theory in phase space in both the classical and quantum mechanical settings. The key to our development is the construction of a normal form for describing the dynamics in the neighbourhood of a specific type of saddle point that governs the evolution from reactants to products in high dimensional systems. In the classical case this is the standard Poincaré–Birkhoff normal form. In the quantum case we develop a normal form based on the Weyl calculus and an explicit algorithm for computing this quantum normal form. The classical normal form allows us to discover and compute the phase space structures that govern classical reaction dynamics. From this knowledge we are able to provide a direct construction of an energy dependent dividing surface in phase space having the properties that trajectories do not locally ‘re-cross’ the surface and the directional flux across the surface is minimal. Using this, we are able to give a formula for the directional flux through the dividing surface that goes beyond the harmonic approximation. We relate this construction to the flux–flux autocorrelation function which is a standard ingredient in the expression for the reaction rate in the chemistry community. We also give a classical mechanical interpretation of the activated complex as a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM), and further describe the structure of the NHIM. The quantum normal form provides us with an efficient algorithm to compute quantum reaction rates and we relate this algorithm to the quantum version of the flux–flux autocorrelation function formalism. The significance of the classical phase space structures for the quantum mechanics of reactions is elucidated by studying the phase space distribution of scattering states. The quantum normal form also provides an efficient way of computing Gamov–Siegert resonances. We relate these resonances to the lifetimes of the quantum activated complex. We consider several one, two and three degree-of-freedom systems and show explicitly how calculations of the above quantities can be carried out. Our theoretical framework is valid for Hamiltonian systems with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and we demonstrate that in several situations it gives rise to algorithms that are computationally more efficient than existing methods.},
