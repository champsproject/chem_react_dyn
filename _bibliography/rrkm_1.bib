	Note = {{The co-dimension of a submanifold is the dimension of the space in which the submanifold exists, minus the dimension of the submanifold. The significance of a submanifold being ``co-dimension one'' is that it is one less dimension than the space in which it exists. Therefore it can ``divide'' the space and act as a separatrix, or barrier, to transport.}}}

@misc{footnote2,
	Note = {{There is a technical point here that, I don't believe, has any effect on this statement, but it is liable to be distracting to the reader. $\text{DS}_{\text i, \text{in}}(E)$ and its boundary is the NHIM. We need to carefully consider the region of $\text{DS}_{\text i, \text{in}}(E)$ near the NHIM and argue that points arbitrarily close to the NHIM correspond to trajectories entering the well (the vector field goes is tangent to the NHIM). I am sure that this is true, but writing it out will result in something that no one will read in a chemistry paper.}}}

The true behavior of the survival probability $P_{\text{S}}(t)$ at \emph{extremely} long times has not however been fully characterized, and merits further study.}}}

	Note = {{The recent work of Paskauskas, Chandre and Uzer \cite{Paskauskas08,Paskauskas09a} has advanced our understanding of the trapping problem in 3 DoF systems. One-parameter families of singly-resonant 2-tori in the vicinity of elliptically stable periodic orbits are identified as the ``backbone'' of the resonance zone associated with such periodic orbits. According to this picture, trapped trajectories initiated close to a stable periodic orbit move in the vicinity of the resonant 2-tori until they reach a sufficiently unstable (normally hyperbolic) 2-torus, at which point they pass along the unstable manifolds of the 2-tori and escape to another region of phase space.}}}
